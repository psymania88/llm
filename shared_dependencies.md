The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so all the components (Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, index.tsx, _app.tsx, _document.tsx) will use React for defining components and managing state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience. The tsconfig.json file is used to configure TypeScript.

4. **CSS Modules**: The CSS Modules methodology is used in the Home.module.css file for styling the components. This methodology ensures that class names are unique and will not conflict with class names in other CSS files.

5. **Public Assets**: The public folder contains static assets like images and icons (favicon.ico, vercel.svg) that can be used across the application.

6. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of npm dependencies that are shared across the application. It also includes scripts for building and running the application.

7. **.next/config.js**: This file is used to customize the default configuration provided by Next.js. The settings in this file are shared across the application.

8. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared across the application. These id names are used to manipulate the DOM and add interactivity to the application.

9. **Function Names**: The function names used in the application are shared across the application. These functions are used to implement the functionality of the application.

10. **Message Names**: The message names used in the application are shared across the application. These messages are used for communication between different parts of the application.
